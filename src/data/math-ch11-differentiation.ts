Start from the derivative definition:

$$
\\dfrac{P(a+h)-P(a)}{h}
=
\\dfrac{(a+h)^{2}-4(a+h)+7-(a^{2}-4a+7)}{h}
$$

Expand the numerator and collect like terms:

$$
\\dfrac{2ah+h^{2}-4h}{h}
=
2a+h-4
$$

The simplified Newton quotient is exactly the one stated, so the statement is True.`,
      `**B.** → True

Once the Newton quotient has been simplified, let $h$ tend to $0$:

$$
P'(x)=2x-4
$$

Now substitute $x=3$:

$$
P'(3)=2\\cdot 3-4=2
$$

The derivative value matches the claim, so the statement is True.`,
      `**C.** → True

First recover the point on the graph:

$$
P(3)=3^{2}-4\\cdot 3+7=4
$$

The tangent line uses point-slope form:

$$
y-P(3)=P'(3)(x-3)
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
y-4=2(x-3)
$$

Hence

$$
y=2x-2
$$

The tangent equation is correct, so the statement is True.`,
      `**D.** → False

The sign of the derivative controls whether the curve rises or falls:

$$
P'(x)=2x-4
$$

For every $x>2$,

$$
2x-4>0
$$

So the curve is increasing, not decreasing, on that interval. The statement is False.`,
      `**E.** → True

Candidate turning points solve

$$
P'(x)=0
$$

That gives

$$
2x-4=0
$$

$$
x=2

Because the coefficient of $x^{2}$ in $P(x)$ is positive, the parabola opens upward. So the stationary point is a minimum. The statement is True.`,

Differentiate term by term:

$$
C(q)=200+12q+\\dfrac{3}{100}q^{2}
$$

The constant disappears, the linear term contributes its coefficient, and the quadratic term uses the power rule:

$$
C'(q)=12+\\dfrac{3}{100}\\cdot 2q
=
12+\\dfrac{3}{50}q

The marginal-cost formula matches the claim, so the statement is True.`,

Substitute $q=100$:

$$
C'(100)=12+\\dfrac{3}{50}\\cdot 100
=
12+6
=
18
$$

The value is correct, so the statement is True.`,
      `**C.** → True

Marginal cost is measured in euros per unit. Therefore

$$
C'(100)=18
$$

means that near $q=100$, one extra unit raises total cost by approximately $18$ euros. The statement is True.`,

Average cost per unit is the quotient

First compute the point on the cost curve:

The tangent line at $q=100$ is

y-C(100)=C'(100)(q-100)

This is a direct power-rule derivative:

So

Q'(L)=5\\cdot \\dfrac{3}{2}L^{\\frac{1}{2}}

The derivative matches the claim, so the statement is True.`,

Evaluate the derivative at $L=4$:

$$
Q'(4)=\\dfrac{15}{2}\\cdot 4^{\\frac{1}{2}}

\\dfrac{15}{2}\\cdot 2
=
15
$$

The value is correct, so the statement is True.`,
      `**C.** → True

The derivative has units of output per labour-hour. Therefore

$$
Q'(4)=15

means that near $L=4$, a small increase of one labour-hour raises output by approximately $15$ units. The statement is True.`,

The derivative still depends on $L$:

Q'(L)=\\dfrac{15}{2}L^{\\frac{1}{2}}

Compare the marginal product at the two labour levels:

Differentiate the full revenue function:

The price derivative is only

Use the quotient formula with

Then

$$
u'=4n+8,\\qquad v'=1.

So

$$
T'(n)=\\dfrac{u'\\cdot v-u\\cdot v'}{v^{2}}
=
\\dfrac{(4n+8)\\cdot (n+1)-(2n^{2}+8n)\\cdot 1}{(n+1)^{2}}.

Expand the numerator:

$$
(4n+8)(n+1)=4n^{2}+4n+8n+8=4n^{2}+12n+8,
$$

$$
4n^{2}+12n+8-(2n^{2}+8n)=2n^{2}+4n+8.

Rewrite the square-root denominator as a negative power:

$$
M(x)=\\dfrac{x^{2}+1}{\\sqrt{x+3}}
=
(x^{2}+1)\\cdot (x+3)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.
$$

The statement is True.`,
      `**B.** → True

Differentiate the rewritten product. Let

$$
u=x^{2}+1,\\qquad v=(x+3)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.
$$

Then

$$
u'=2x
$$

and

$$
v'=-\\dfrac{1}{2}(x+3)^{-\\frac{3}{2}}.
$$

So

$$
M'(x)=2x\\cdot (x+3)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}+(x^{2}+1)\\cdot \\left(-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)(x+3)^{-\\frac{3}{2}}
$$

$$
=2x(x+3)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}-\\dfrac{1}{2}(x^{2}+1)(x+3)^{-\\frac{3}{2}}.
$$

Put both terms over the common denominator $2(x+3)^{3/2}$:

$$
M'(x)=\\dfrac{2\\cdot 2x\\cdot (x+3)-(x^{2}+1)}{2(x+3)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}
=
\\dfrac{4x(x+3)-(x^{2}+1)}{2(x+3)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}.
$$

Expand the numerator:

$$
4x(x+3)-(x^{2}+1)=4x^{2}+12x-x^{2}-1=3x^{2}+12x-1.
$$

Therefore

$$
M'(x)=\\dfrac{3x^{2}+12x-1}{2(x+3)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}.

The statement is True.`,

Differentiate term by term. First,

$$
\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\bigl(2t\\cdot\\ln(2t+1)\\bigr)
=
2\\ln(2t+1)+2t\\cdot\\dfrac{2}{2t+1}
=
2\\ln(2t+1)+\\dfrac{4t}{2t+1}.
$$

Second,

$$
\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\dfrac{2t^{2}}{2t+1}\\right)
=
\\dfrac{4t(2t+1)-2t^{2}\\cdot 2}{(2t+1)^{2}}
=
\\dfrac{8t^{2}+4t-4t^{2}}{(2t+1)^{2}}
=
\\dfrac{4t^{2}+4t}{(2t+1)^{2}}.
$$

Adding these contributions yields the claimed $Z''(t)$. The statement is True.`,
      `**D.** → False

Part B shows the correct value is $2\\ln 3+\\dfrac{2}{3}$, not $2\\ln 3+1$. The statement is False.`,
      `**E.** → True

Substitute $t=1$ into the second-derivative formula:

$$
Z''(1)=2\\ln 3+\\dfrac{4}{3}+\\dfrac{4+4}{9}
=
2\\ln 3+\\dfrac{4}{3}+\\dfrac{8}{9}.
$$

The statement is True.`,
